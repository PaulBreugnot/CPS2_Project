# Web application

This part of the big project **Workshop context acquisition and representation in ITMâ€™Factory** is design to have a graphical interface for the user and allow him to actually see the results of the others part of the project. You can find more information about this project [here](https://www.emse.fr/~picard/cours/cps2/cps2-projects.html#trues2-workshop-context-acquisition-and-representation-in-itm-factory).

This web app is a Vue.js client application, which works with [mqtt-realtime-chart-client](https://github.com/NickJokic/mqtt-realtime-chart-client) [vue-tree](https://github.com/halower/vue-tree) and [vue-scrollactive](https://github.com/eddiemf/vue-scrollactive).


## Features
### Map

+ not dynamic, need to reload the map if sensors are added
